# Eyepoint Access: Secure Remote Access Redefined {#1df7da55074f80bb8f09cb3e68c39618}


**We are redefining endpoint security for a remote-first world by protecting data where it matters the most: at the user’s eye level.**


## **The Problem** {#1df7da55074f8085961de16109e27ec0}


Endpoint devices are vulnerable. Attackers can take over applications or the operating system, even when strict security policies are in place. Whenever sensitive data appears on an endpoint display screen, it is an opportunity for an attacker, and the discovery of zero-day and supply chain attacks is so common that it is nearly impossible to trust any laptop or smartphone hardware or software. 


Some organizations value the flexibility of remote work, but risk data leaks from endpoint devices. Other organizations sacrifice remote work benefits and enforce strict air-gap policies to protect sensitive information.


## **Our Solution** {#1df7da55074f80af8119d877e71e16aa}


Our patented **augmented reality (AR) glasses** combine air-gap security with the flexibility of remote work. Data remains encrypted on a user’s laptop or smartphone and only becomes readable once it reaches the AR glasses and never passing through the operating system in plaintext. This approach prevents attackers from seeing confidential data, even if they gain control over the endpoint.


In addition, the AR environment keeps user input (such as signing documents or interacting with web apps) secure, preventing interception and replay attacks.


## **How It Works** {#1df7da55074f80dc9af7d41b574d42d7}

1. **Encrypted Display.** When users open or view confidential data, the application displays a visually encrypted version on-screen.
2. **AR Decryption.** Our AR glasses detect and match encryption keys, then decrypt the data and overlay clear text over the application screen.
3. **Biometric Binding.** Each user’s biometric data helps generate unique encryption keys so only the rightful wearer can access the information. If the glasses are lost or stolen, the data remains protected.
4. **Air-Gap.** The AR glasses are isolated from the network, making remote compromise virtually impossible. Decryption happens only at eye level, so sensitive data never appears in plaintext at the endpoint or over the network.

Employees can open sensitive documents on any laptop, yet the text remains encrypted until viewed through our AR glasses, preventing unauthorized screenshots or key logging.


## **The Market Opportunity** {#1df7da55074f80f38ee5da036285e0a3}


Some organizations prefer the flexibility of remote work, while others prefer strict air-gap policies. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages:

- **Remote work networks** offer high productivity but can lead to data leaks.
- **Closed air-gap networks** minimize data leaks but also limit productivity.

Our solution provides **both** high productivity and low risk of data leaks, serving organizations that currently prefer air-gap networks and those striving to enable safe remote work.
